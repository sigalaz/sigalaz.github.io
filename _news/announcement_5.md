Paticipated at an entrepreneurship constest with [Jump Chile](https://www.jumpchile.com/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=ads&utm_campaign=campanas_postulacion) along my team with [Cristian Funck](https://github.com/cefunck) and Francisco Kalchgruber and our project AgroVisual Solutions, a Computer Vision based service made to early detect different kind of plages that could be present on agriculture fields. We made it to the top 100!. Sadly we couldn't advance further but during the 3 months we learned a lot about how to actually bring an idea to business.
