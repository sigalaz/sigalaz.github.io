Had a fun time asisting to [IEEE RAS International Summer School on Deep Learning for Robot Vision](http://robotvision2019.amtc.cl/). During the week we could review a lot of interesting topics like Reinforcement Learning and Semantic Slam. I was also able to talk to proffesors and a many passionate robotics students from around the world. :robot: :smile:
