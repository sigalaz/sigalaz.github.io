# Making my own Blog/Portfolio
This is the repo to design my own [website](https://sigalaz.github.io/). The main goal for the creation is to learn a bit more about web development by using the kind of tools that a static site would require.
About the content I expect keep it constantly updated with the different project that I have built and also that I will be building in the future /n
